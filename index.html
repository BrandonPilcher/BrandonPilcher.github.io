        <h4> Description </h4>
        <p> A 1967 Corvette is a classic sports car with a sleek and muscular design that exudes power and style. The
                car has a long, low-slung body that sits close to the ground, with a distinctive pointed nose and a
                sharply raked windshield. The body of the car is characterized by sweeping curves and bold lines, with a
                pronounced bulge over the hood and flared fenders that give it a muscular and aggressive look. I
                replicated this by bolding the body lines and using a bright color to draw your attention. This image
                was made using Asprite.

        <h4> Description </h4>
        <p> A cave with stalagmites and stalactites is a natural wonder that showcases the beauty and power of
                geological processes. Stalagmites are formations that grow upward from the floor of the cave, while
                stalactites grow downward from the ceiling. This particular cave was used as a spider den for a boss in
                a 2d platformer. The image took 8 hours to complete and was made using Asprite.
