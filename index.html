                <p> My name is Brandon Pilcher. I am 20 years old and am currently a Sophmore in the GIMM
                        program and Boise State University. The purpose of this website is to show off the
                        projects I
                        have made to represent my experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Unity.</p>

        <h2> Project One </h2>
        <h3> 2D 1967 Corvette</h3>

        <h4> Description </h4>
        <p> Above is a 1967 Corvette Stingray drawing using Aesprite in a 2D format. I chose to
                do this
                for fun as a spur of the moment project. My passion is cars and drawing so to
                grow in
                how I can creat art starting to make 2D art is just the first step.</p>

        <h2> Project Two </h2>
        <h3> Spider Den Boss Room </h3>
        <br>
        <div>
                <a> <img src="Artifacts/SpiderDen.jpeg" alt="Image Not Found"> </a>
        </div>

        <h4> Description </h4>
        <p> This Spider Den was made for a game developed in my freshman year of
                college. There
                were multiple boss room backgrounds made and mine made the final cut.
                This took
                about 8 hours to create and I am more than happy with the final outcome.
