                        <p> My name is Brandon Pilcher. I am 20 years old and am currently a Sophmore in the GIMM
                                program and Boise State University. The purpose of this website is to show off the
                                projects I
                                have made to represent my experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Unity.</p>

                        <h4> Description </h4>
                        <p> Above is a 1967 Corvette Stingray drawing using Aesprite in a 2D format. I chose to do this
                                for fun as a spur of the moment project. My passion is cars and drawing so to grow in
                                how I can creat art starting to make 2D art is just the first step.</p>

                                <h4> Description </h4>
                                <p> This Spider Den was made for a game developed in my freshman year of college. There
                                        were multiple boss room backgrounds made and mine made the final cut. This took
                                        about 8 hours to create and I am more than happy with the final outcome. </p>
